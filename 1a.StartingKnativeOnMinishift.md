## Knative on Minishift

We will be using Knative operator to install Knative on minishift. 


### Initial Prep
Ensure you are running latest [minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift). This works on `minishift v1.33.0+ba29431`. 

```
$ minishift version
minishift v1.33.0+ba29431
```

If your minishift version is old run `minishift update`. Also if you are running minishift stop it by running `minishift stop`.



### Download Knative Operator

Clone the knative-operators repo by running 

```git clone https://github.com/openshift-cloud-functions/knative-operators```

This will create a directory named `knative-operators`. Change over to this directory.

`cd knative-operators`

The installation scripts are in `etc/scripts` folder.

You can view the installation script for minishift running `cat ./etc/scripts/install-on-minishift.sh`. Note that this will create a minishift profile named `knative`. It will delete any profile that exists with that name and set up a new one.

### Install Knative on Minishift

Run knative Operator to install Knative on minishift by running

```
$ ./etc/scripts/install-on-minishift.sh
```

This will take a several minutes to run.  It first starts minishift, uses istio operator to install Istio. Once Istio is running, it installs knative-serving, knative-build, and knative-eventing using respective operators. 

Currently the installer will install the following versions for each of the knative components.

```
 KNATIVE_SERVING_VERSION=v0.3.0
 KNATIVE_BUILD_VERSION=v0.3.0
 KNATIVE_EVENTING_VERSION=v0.3.0
```

Watch the pods in the `knative-serving`,  to see they are in `Running` status

```
$ oc get pods -n knative-serving
