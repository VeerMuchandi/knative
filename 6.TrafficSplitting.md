## Traffic Splitting Example

Let us deploy an application whose revision points to stocks. The sample below shows the configuration and route configured for this revision

```

apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: stock-configuration-example
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  revisionTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        knative.dev/type: container
    spec:
      container:
        # This is the Go import path for the binary to containerize
        # and substitute here.
        image: docker.io/veermuchandi/rest-api-go 
        env:
          - name: RESOURCE
            value: stock
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /

apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: stock-route-example
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  traffic:
  - configurationName: stock-configuration-example
    percent: 100
```

**Note** that this creates a configuration passes an environment variable `RESOURCE=stock`.

Let us apply this to create the configuration and route.

```
$ kubectl apply -f traffic-splitting/sample.yaml -n myproject
configuration.serving.knative.dev/stock-configuration-example created
route.serving.knative.dev/stock-route-example created
```

Now you have a single configuration and a revision.
```
$ kubectl get configuration -n myproject
NAME                          CREATED AT
stock-configuration-example   19m

$ kubectl get revision -n myproject
NAME                                CREATED AT
stock-configuration-example-00001   21m

$ kubectl get route -n myproject
NAME                  CREATED AT
stock-route-example   19m

```

Now test the application

Gather the connection details for your service

```
$ export URL=$(kubectl get route stock-route-example -n myproject -o jsonpath={.status.domain})
$ export IP_ADDRESS=$(minikube ip):$(kubectl get svc knative-ingressgateway -n istio-system -o 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}')
```

Test the service and note that it is connecting to `stock app`.
```
$ curl -H "Host: ${URL}" "http://${IP_ADDRESS}"
Welcome to the stock app! 
```

### Update Configuration

Let us update the configuration to `share` by passing a `RESOURCE=share`

```
$ cat traffic-splitting/updated_configuration.yaml 
# Copyright 2018 The Knative Authors
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: stock-configuration-example
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  revisionTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        knative.dev/type: container
    spec:
      container:
        # This is the Go import path for the binary to containerize
        # and substitute here.
        image: docker.io/veermuchandi/rest-api-go 
        env:
          - name: RESOURCE
            value: share
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
          initialDelaySeconds: 3
          periodSeconds: 3
```

Apply this new configuration

```
$ kubectl apply -f traffic-splitting/updated_configuration.yaml 
configuration.serving.knative.dev/stock-configuration-example configured
```

Now you'll see an additional revision that points to the `share` 

```
$ kubectl get configuration -n myproject
NAME                          CREATED AT
stock-configuration-example   21m

$ kubectl get revision -n myproject
NAME                                CREATED AT
stock-configuration-example-00001   21m
stock-configuration-example-00002   1m

$ kubectl get revision stock-configuration-example-00002  -n myproject -o yaml
...
...
spec:
  concurrencyModel: Multi
  container:
    env:
    - name: RESOURCE
      value: share
    image: docker.io/veermuchandi/rest-api-go
...
...

```

As soon as you deploy a new revision the route is automatically pointed to the new revision, so the test will still show the `share` revision.

```
$ kubectl get route -n myproject -o yaml
...
...
  spec:
    generation: 1
    traffic:
    - configurationName: stock-configuration-example
      percent: 100
...
...
  status:
   ...
   ...
    traffic:
    - configurationName: stock-configuration-example
      percent: 100
      revisionName: stock-configuration-example-00002
...
...

$ curl -H "Host: ${URL}" "http://${IP_ADDRESS}"
Welcome to the share app!
```

### Traffic Splitting

Let us update the route with the following configuration to split the traffic between two revisions.

```
$ cat traffic-splitting/split-route.yaml 
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: stock-route-example
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  traffic:
  - revisionName: stock-configuration-example-00001 
    percent: 50 
  - revisionName: stock-configuration-example-00002 
    percent: 50  

```

Let us apply this route.

```
$ kubectl apply -f traffic-splitting/split-route.yaml -n myproject
route.serving.knative.dev/stock-route-example configured
```

Now test the application by running curl a few times. Initially it will show one of the revisions whose pod comes up faster. Give it a few minutes and the traffic will be split between the two versions approximately 50%.


```
$ for i in {1..20}; do curl -H "Host: ${URL}" "http://${IP_ADDRESS}"; done
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the stock app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the share app! 
Welcome to the share app!
```

and you can see both the pods for both revisions running after you run this testing

```
$ kubectl get po -n myproject
NAME                                                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
stock-configuration-example-00001-deployment-578cdb47ff-fftd4   3/3       Running   0          1m
stock-configuration-example-00002-deployment-b849b959d-sgm7w    3/3       Running   0          2m
```

### Cleanup

Run the `kubectl delete` to clean up the project

```
$ kubectl delete -f traffic-splitting/sample.yaml 
configuration.serving.knative.dev "stock-configuration-example" deleted
route.serving.knative.dev "stock-route-example" deleted
```
